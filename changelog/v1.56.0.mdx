## New Features 🚀

1. **New Onboarding Experience**  
   Onboarding is now streamlined so you can get started faster and begin accepting payments without unnecessary delays.
   - Faster account activation
   - Simplified verification process

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
   Enhanced account security with two-factor authentication support. Protect your merchant account and team members with an additional layer of security beyond passwords.
   - Secure your account against unauthorized access
   - Support for authenticator apps
   - Required for sensitive operations

3. **Session Links in Overlay Checkout**  
   Checkout sessions now integrate seamlessly with overlay checkout, providing a smoother embedded payment experience. Create checkout sessions and display them in an overlay without redirecting customers away from your application.

4. **C# SDK**  
   The official Dodo Payments C# SDK is now available, bringing native .NET support for integrating payment functionality into your C# and .NET applications.
   - Full type safety with C# interfaces
   - Async/await support for all API operations
   - Available on NuGet for easy installation

5. **Webhook Verification in All SDKs**  
   All SDKs now include built-in webhook verification functions to securely validate incoming webhook events. Powered by the industry-standard [webhooks library](https://github.com/standard-webhooks), these functions make it simple to verify and process webhook payloads.
   
   Two methods are available:
   - `unwrap()`: Verifies webhook signatures using your webhook secret key for production use
   - `unsafe_unwrap()`: Parses webhook payloads without verification for local testing and development
   
   To use webhook verification, provide your `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` when initializing the Dodo Payments client. Both functions automatically parse the webhook payload and extract the event type, making webhook handling more secure and convenient.
