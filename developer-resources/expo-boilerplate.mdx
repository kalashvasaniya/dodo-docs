<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Clone the boilerplate repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodopayments/expo-boilerplate.git
cd expo-boilerplate
```
</Step>

<Step title="Get Your API Credentials">
Obtain your credentials from the Dodo Payments dashboard in Test Mode:

- **API Key**: Navigate to **Developer → API Keys** in your [dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com)

<Tip>
Start with Test Mode to safely test your integration without processing real payments.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your Dodo Payments credentials:

```bash .env
EXPO_PUBLIC_DODO_API_KEY=your_test_api_key_here
```

<Warning>
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Development Server">
Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your device, or press `i` for iOS simulator or `a` for Android emulator.
